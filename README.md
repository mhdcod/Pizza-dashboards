# Pizza_dashboards

breakdown of my work step by step :

1) Analyzed the client's needs and the existing database structure as outlined in the Project Specification Document.
2) Developed the relational database model using QuickDBD.com. The model is visualized in the modele.png file, and the corresponding SQL code was extracted to define the database structure.
3) Implemented the database schema in MySQL Workbench, creating the necessary tables and relationships.
4) Leveraged AI tools to generate relevant data, which was then inserted into the database using SQL scripts.
5) Crafted SQL queries to extract pertinent data, which was then exported to CSV files for further analysis.
6) Imported the extracted data into Google Looker Studio, preparing it into datastes for visualization and analysis
7) Designed and developed dashboards using tables, graphs, and maps, ensuring the data accurately reflected the clientâ€™s requirements.
8) Focused on the user interface and user experience design of the dashboards, optimizing them for clarity, accessibility, and client needs.
